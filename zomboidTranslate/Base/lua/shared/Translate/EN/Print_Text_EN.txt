"GENEVA, Switzerland - The World Health Organization has decried the hundreds of bomb and death threats against its headquarters and staff in Geneva, calling them "an extremely unhelpful response in a time of unprecedented crisis." Swiss police are closely monitoring the situation, which comes in the wake of the WHO's advice on July 11 for international flights worldwide to be grounded due to the Knox outbreak.\n The advice, though voluntary, has been followed by almost every airline in the world, leaving millions of national and international travelers stranded, and forcing governments around the world to deal with the sudden stranding of vast numbers of tourists within their borders at the height...\n"..

Both military and refugees near the border pulled back to Louisville.\n Large groups of the infected attacked houses in the suburbs throughout the day, moving slowly north towards the city, meeting only sporadic resistance, mostly by armed civilians. The streets and bridges out of Louisville quickly filled with panicked citizens fleeing over the Ohio River, and traffic jams have been reported as far north as Columbus, Ohio, and Indianapolis, Ind. Rioting and looting in other major cities have mostly given way to an orderly despair as citizens stock up on food, ammunition and other goods in case the scenes of panic and looting in Kentucky are repeated further afield.\n Military authorities have refused to answer questions about their...\n".."(See "Border", A9)\n\n"..

"KNOX REGION, KY - Some refugees and personnel outside of the Exclusion Zone claim to have fallen ill from the "Knox Virus" despite not coming into contact with the infected. The claims have called in question statements from the authorities that the sickness can spread only through bites and scratches.\n A CDC official said the emergence of aerial transmission represented, "a greater threat to humanity than the Spanish Flu or the Black Death". The WHO has said the virus is likely already around the world, and that its advice to ground flights "almost certainly came too late to make a difference." Screening programs for the illness...\n"..
